# Features of the Authorization Server
* All 4 grant types exposed out of the box
* Access/Refresh Tokens
* All Tokens are [JWT based tokens](https://jwt.io/)
* Configurable expiration times on tokens
* Single Sign On (SSO) Example
* Example of trusted clients
* REST tokeninfo endPoint for verifying a token is valid.
* REST revoke endPoint for revoking either an access token or a refresh token.
* Authorization tokens are only useable once and are short expiring JWT tokens
* Full tokens are NOT stored in the DB since they are JWT signed tokens.  Only ID's of tokens are stored.
* SSL/HTTPS usage
* Unit and Integration tests of the majority of code and OAuth2 flows
* More complex UI Examples for the Sign In/Login and the Decision Screens
